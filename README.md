> Roadmap for everyone who wants DevSecOps.

## What is DevSecOps and Why is it Important?
DevSecOps is a culture and practice that aims to integrate security into every phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
It emphasizes collaboration between Development, Security, and Operations teams.
The goal is to build secure software from the ground up, reduce vulnerabilities, and ensure faster, safer deployments.
This roadmap provides a curated list of resources and tools to help individuals and organizations implement DevSecOps practices.

## üìñ How to Use This Roadmap
This roadmap is designed to be a comprehensive guide for individuals and organizations looking to adopt or improve their DevSecOps practices. Here's how you can make the most of it:

1.  **Understand the Basics:** If you're new to DevSecOps, start with the "What is DevSecOps and Why is it Important?" section to get a foundational understanding.
2.  **View the Big Picture:** The main **Roadmap** image provides a visual overview of the different stages and areas within DevSecOps. Use this to orient yourself.
3.  **Explore Tools:** The **Tools** section offers a curated list of software and services that can help you implement various DevSecOps capabilities.
4.  **Dive into Resources:** The **Resources** section is categorized by the DevSecOps lifecycle (Design, Develop, Build, Test, Deploy, Operate and Monitor). Each category contains links to articles, guides, and official documentation. You can explore these based on your specific needs or areas of interest.
5.  **Focus on CI/CD Security:** If your focus is on securing your pipelines, the **Security of CICD** section provides targeted resources.
6.  **Contribute:** This is a community-driven effort. If you have suggestions, find broken links, or want to add new resources, please see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

You don't have to go through it linearly. Feel free to jump to the sections that are most relevant to your current challenges or learning goals.
